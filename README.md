Sleepy-Story
============

This is a story that is hopefully going to be uploaded on [mcstories](http://www.mcstories.com/). 
It is in reality a thinly veiled advertisement for [sleepychat](http://www.sleepychat.com/), a chatting site for hypnotists and subjects, which needs more love.

The story centers around a girl name Samantha who is frustrated with a hypnosis site (Omegle, but we don't mention it by name), but a friend tells her about Sleepychat and she has all kinds of wacky adventures. She starts out in matchmaking, later does stuff in the public chat, and *maybe* she'll do skype eventually, although she isn't comfortable with that at the begining.

Also, not sure how the others have been picturing her but I (scott) imagine her kinda like this:
