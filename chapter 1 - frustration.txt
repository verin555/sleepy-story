Nothing in this story actually happened, to out knowledge, although almost everything is withing the bounds of reality. The website mentioned here, sleepychat.com, does indeed exist. Several of the people mentioned here are real, however Samantha is not.  

------------
        Samantha walked slowly among the dusty chests, trying to let her eyes adjust to the gloom inside the warehouse. She could just make out the vague outlines of old bowling pins, a springboard, a rusty cage, a rack full of garishly colored, mothballed clown costumes. This place gave her the creeps, why the hell did Johnny want to go "exploring" an old storage warehouse for old circus stuff and then just leave her by herself?
        "Johnny?" What a jerk, just up and disappearing on her like that. "Come on, Johnny. You better not jump out and scare me with some kooky old mask, or we're over." 
        She heard rustling in the costume rack. She was getting a bit angry at how childish he was being. "Johnny, come out of there. Are you seri--"
        A gloved hand came out from between the puffy suits. It was definitely not John's hand, but Samantha wasn't looking at it. Rather, her attention was caught by what it was holding. A gold coin, tied on a string to make a pendulum. It was spinning, first one way, then the other, catching the light beautifully.
        Flashes of light, which seemed so much brighter in the darkness, dazzled her vision as she began to hear a soothing voice call out to her.

                Left in blackness; darkness deep,
                Now fall into a stone-like sleep.
                Watch the pretty coin of gold,
                And you will do as you are told!
        
        And just like that, her entire world seemed to unfocus. She could almost make out the voice, deep and lyrical, rumbling on in a slow, even pacing. What was left of her mind didn't understand what was happening, didn't know what she was doing. She could feel her body moving to his voice, listening and obeying gave her pleasure, it felt so good, he had her completely under his control.
        An orgasm rocked through her, taking her completely under, making her forever his slave...
        
        Coming out of her fantasy, Samantha Agard laid back on her bed and enjoyed the afterglow of a pretty good orgasm. She didn't have anything to do this Sunday morning, and as happened occansionally when she was idle, her thoughts turned to sex. She wouldn't call herself a nymphomaniac, but she had a healthy desire when it came to certain things.
        She spent her day lazing around, enjoying her break after a long work week. Next week would be a little tougher, so she figured resting now would help. She started feeling horny again in the late evening, but just masturbating again seemed a little boring. 
        Well, she could always try adding other people to the mix again... Would it be different than last time?
        Samantha turned on her computer and stared at the screen, the only light in her bedroom. She was a little apprehensive of what she would find once she clicked the red “Start the Chat!” button; it was a feeling not unlike opening an unexpected letter from the IRS. She remembered when she first stumbled across this chat site, how excited she was. A huge pool of users which could be filtered by interest, so that anyone could chat about whatever subject they wanted.
        For her, the subject was erotic hypnosis. Samantha had an interest in hypnosis since her first stirrings of puberty. Thinking back on it, she could only speculate that her fascination had come from various Saturday morning cartoons (her fantasy this morning being a testament to that), where she watched the heroine or damsel-in-distress fall under the complete control of the all-powerful villain. Obedient. Submissive. Helpless. As she matured, she realized she wanted that for herself, to be taken deep into trance, to have her psyche laid bare, to be reshaped into whatever pleased her hypnotist.
        From her experience, it was apparently going to be a lifelong quest to get there.
        She clicked the button, and was connected with a stranger. The automated message appeared: “You and your chatting partner both like Erotic Hypnosis. Enjoy!”
        She waited, and when enough time had passed without activity, she decided to be proactive.
 
You: Hello!
Stranger: Hi.
You: How are you today?
Stranger: Fine.
Stranger: a/s/r?
You: 24/f/sub
Chatbot: The Stranger has disconnected.
 
        “Ok, that one was a sub, too.” She mumbled to herself. She tried to be as indifferent as possible. “Let’s try one more time before bed.”
        She opened another chat session.
 
Stranger: hey there
You: Hi, how are you?
Stranger: whats your trigger?
You: For trance?
Stranger: yep
You: I don’t have one.
You: I haven’t been in trance before.
Stranger: That’s ok,
Stranger: I can give you one,
Stranger: all you hve to do is listen and obey
Stranger: m/f?
You: I’m a girl.
Stranger: Ok my good girl, just feel yourseflf start to relax
Stranger: breath slowly, in and out
 
        Samantha consciously slowed her breathing, and sat back in her chair.
 
Stranger: out loud
Stranger: Count backwards from 10
Stranger: sinking deepeer
 
        She did as she was told, counting under her breath. She was beginning to feel excited as she followed the commands on her screen.
 
Stranger: also type along with what you say
You: 8
You: 7
You: 6
You: 5
You: 4
You: 3
Stranger: fall deeper into trance as you count
You: 2
You: 1
Stranger: Good Girl. Deep int rance
Stranger: You will orgasm everytime I say “good girl”
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
 
        Samantha saw the words and understood what they were supposed to do, but… nothing. Nada. She was awake, sitting here in her chair in the middle of the night, definitely not orgasming.
 
Stranger: Now my girl, what are you wearing?
You: A t-shirt and shorts
Stranger: the shorts come off now,
Stranger: go deeper as you obey
Stranger: do it now…….
 
        Samantha stood up and pulled her shorts down, leaving them around her ankles as she sat back down. She was fairly sure she wasn’t in trance. She still felt a nice rush from willingly doing tasks demanded of her, but she was under the impression that hypnosis would leave her completely unable to disobey. She wanted to be in a position where she could struggle against it as much as she wanted to and it wouldn’t make any difference how quickly her shorts came off.
        
        Maybe she would slip under if she tried to focus on what trance would be like?
 
Stranger: Are they off??
You: Yes.
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: You will addrress me as “Sir” or “Master”
Stranger: understand?
You: Yes, Sir.
Stranger: GOOD GIRL
Stranger: is my girl wearing panties?
You: Yes, Master.
Stranger: what color?
You: Green, Sir.
Stranger: Very good. Skype?
You: I’m not comfortable enough for that, Sir.
Stranger: ok, we’ll soon fix that,
Stranger: go deeper for me
Stranger: feel yourself going blank, no thoughts except my will
Stranger: everytime I say “DEEPER” you feel weak,
Stranger: unable to think for yourself
Stranger: DEEPER
 
        Samantha disconnected. She felt depressed and disgusted. It was late. She logged into Hypnohub, and started scrolling through a mountains of pictures that just weren’t well-done enough to make her feel anything.
        She was wondering whether she would finish a progect her work wanted her to do tonight, or put it off to tomorrow. She decided that she porobably should finish the project today, even though she didn't feel very good. For some reason, immoral hyonotists just had that effect on her. Just as she was thinking that, a freind of hers sent her a message.
 
<12:43 AM>
The_Id_Monster: What’s up?
Tweety44: Nothing.
Tweety44: Actually,
Tweety44: not feeling so good.
The_Id_Monster: ?
Tweety44: It’s just,
Tweety44: for actual hypnosis,
Tweety44: files don’t work, and finding random people to chat with usually means you’ll find an asshole 90% of the time
Tweety44: An asshole who pushes you more than you’re comfortable with.
The_Id_Monster: I personally prefer the fantasy to the real thing.
The_Id_Monster: It avoids a lot of those problems
Tweety44: Yeah,
Tweety44: but the thing is, other people have no problem with it.
Tweety44: I’m so jealous!
The_Id_Monster: I’ve heard that it just takes time
The_Id_Monster: It’s like learning the piano or something.
Tweety44: Eh,
Tweety44: I dunno.
The_Id_Monster: 
The_Id_Monster: Well,
The_Id_Monster: do you think
The_Id_Monster: a smaller community would help?
The_Id_Monster: There’s this new site called Sleepychat
The_Id_Monster: Since it’s so young, it’s got a small community
The_Id_Monster: like only 30 people at a time.
Tweety44: You think that’ll help?
The_Id_Monster: It could.
The_Id_Monster: I’m thinking about the difference between a state college with hundreds of thousands of students, and a small university with a couple thousand,
The_Id_Monster: The teachers had more time to devote to each student, and things were less crazy.
Tweety44: Makes sense.
The_Id_Monster: So you’ll try it out?
Tweety44: Probably
The_Id_Monster: Good. ‘Cause you’re more beautiful when you’re happy. ;)
Tweety44: I need sign off, I still had a bit of work to do
Tweety44: Bye
The_Id_Monster: Cya
Tweety44: :)
 
        She logged out of the site, pulled up her pants, then decided to make herself some dinner before she went to work. As warmed up some pasta, she mulled over the conversation. What he said sounded promising, but she wasn’t completely convinced. Who’s to say whether people weren’t assholes there, too? Instead of the school analogy, it could be the difference between being with a creepy pervert in a big room and being with a creepy pervert in a small room. Then again, maybe she should try to have more faith in people. 

        The mircowave beeped, and she took out the pasta. After putting an abnormally high amount of Parmigiano-Reggiano (She refused to call it simply "Parmesan"), she sat down and tried to work. She was a graphic designer, and had to design a page layout for a 7th grade science book. She tried to work on it for a few minutes, but it was so boring that she was worried it might actually put her in a trance, and she would wake up four hours later knowing *far* too much about the various types of molecular bonds. It was getting late anyway, so she decided to get some sleep.
